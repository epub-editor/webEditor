<br/><p id="p181"><strong>GEE Training.</strong> In the late 1930's Englishman Robert Dippy proposed a system of synchronised pulsing.In 1941 the 'boffins' were given the task of developing a system which would give an accurate ground position without any visual reference. The result was Gee. It consisted of three transmitters - a master and 2 slaves - arranged in an arc about 100 miles apart. The display was a cathode-ray tube (hence the Duty "Screen"), and the numbers deduced were applied to a special Gee chart of intersecting 'hyperbolic lines of position'. Gee was on VHF, and was, consequently, only line-of -sight. It's range was around 3-400 miles on a good day.
