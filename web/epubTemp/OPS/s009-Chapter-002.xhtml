            <h1 id="h17">BOMBER MISSION PART TWO</h1>

            <p class="title-sub-rw" id="title-sub3" epub:type="subtitle">&#160;The continuation</p>

         </div>

         <p id="p45">Another bang and back to earth conscious of the fact that the cord attached to one&#8217;s leg has become very tight and cannot make any further headway, pull and tug all useless, so decide to cut the cord, difficulty in getting knife out of pocket, then opening blade with teeth, to find that being outstretched could not reach the cord to cut it.&#160;</p>

         <p id="p96">Try, make a wild slash, miss, try again, miss and all the time edging further out on this small branch to get sufficient play to allow the cutting of this silk cord and then made it, to recover consciousness six hours later laying at the foot of a very large tree having no recollection of falling whatsoever. Try to move, agony, at last manage it by dragging oneself with the aid of the tree stagger a few yards collapse, up again, one thought must hide, must get away, only to pass out again.</p>

         <p id="p46">Another four hours, six o'clock, first early light filtering through the trees, again the thought must get away, must hide. Endeavour to get up, terrible pain, coughing blood but manage and with the help of a stout stick manage to stumble along a few yards, a rest and on again stopping here and there to examine what are quite obviously parts of our aircraft&#8212;a piece of plywood, a twisted duralinium piece, the lids from my sextant case. Poor old E for Edward, what an inglorious finish, yet I guess that's how you wanted it. After all you were built for fighting and you went out that way, a pity you had to take the boys with you, but perhaps you know best for who can look into the future to see what it holds.</p>

         <p id="p47">A track, follow it and eventually strike a rough country lane leading through the wood, proceed along this, resting every few yards and arrive at the spot where it leaves the wood. Take bearing of what is before, and it seems as seen in the early morning light as if it's a small valley entirely surrounded by large fir forests.&#160;</p>

         <p id="p97">I can look across and about a mile and a half away can make out a small village, cultivated fields in the immediate foreground with a stream wandering through. A few wisps of smoke from one or two of the chimneys give the fact away that life is in existence. Follow the road down with my eye and notice that it branches down by a bridge, one arm going over the bridge and into the village, the other leading up and over a small hill into the woods again.&#160;</p>

         <p id="p98">Close at hand and standing back in one of the fields I notice a shed and decide that it will be a good place to head for and lay up for the day, try to dry my clothes and examine my injuries, struggled on and upon arrival find that it is about half filled with hay. Ah! A good place, can get really organised, take out my escape kit which I always carried sewn in the back pocket of my battle dress, checked the compass, tried sucking a couple of malted milk tablets but think I must have swallowed too much blood for they made me sick, so lay down to rest, but must have passed out, guess that journey must have been too much, couldn't even clamber on top of the hay.&#160;</p>

         <p id="p99">Next thing a scream and one wakes up with a German girl, one hand to mouth and pointing at me with the other; she had apparently driven up in a bullock wagon to load some of the hay for feeding cattle. Flaxen haired and braided into two long plaids and with a certain amount of terror in her eyes, she made a most impressive picture.</p>

         <p id="p144">She asked me in German if I was English. I nodded my head. She then asked if I could speak German, to which I shook my head, her father then arrived. They placed me in the cart and took me along to the house.</p>

         <div class="paras-rw blank-line-rw exclude-auto-rw" id="blank-line4">

</div>

         <p id="p48">I must now skip the next week or ten days; sufficient is it to say that I was held in solitary confinement, asking all the time for medical attention which was denied me and eventually travelling down to Frankfort on Maine with eight other chaps who had been picked up. I might say that if it had not been for them I should never have made that trip.</p>

         <p id="p49">More solitary confinement, hard wooden bench to lay upon, food terrible, couldn't eat anyway, interrogation, threats, Gestapo, still asking for doctor and still no response. At last after eleven days was taken out and placed with ten or dozen other chaps, we were told that we were being transferred to a transit camp situated in a park in the city, which turned out to be true.</p>

         <p id="p50">There I met all sorts of aircrew, Yanks etc. and everybody conscious that the other chap might be a plant by the Germans and acting accordingly. This camp was run by the P.O.W.&#8217;s themselves and this is where a new P.O.W. first comes into contact with what the Red Cross was doing and something I might say which comes as a great surprise, something also which the longer one was a prisoner the more one came to the conclusion that it was what was keeping us alive, as events proved later.</p>

         <p id="p51">Here I had my first shave in three weeks, and a clean singlet, a couple of handkerchiefs which were drastically needed; we also found that the amount of food we could consume was definitely limited even after so short a while.</p>

         <p id="p52">Tried to get more medical attention, but that night a raid on the city of Frankfort stirred up the people so that the guards would not take the risk of taking us along to the local hospital.</p>

         <p id="p53">Next day a party of eight was made up to be sent to the main P.O.W. camp at Sagan, Stalag Luft III&#8212;was assured that first class medical attention would be available there.</p>

         <p id="p145">The transport turned out to be cattle trucks with barbed wire strung around them, and forty chaps to a truck, and to cap all, the German officer in charge wanted us to remove our boots, to ensure that we would not try and escape, but we kicked up such a row that finally we were allowed to keep them on and have two Luftwaffe guards placed in each truck with us.</p>

         <h2 id="h23">Arriving at Stalag Luft III</h2>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p100">That journey was one long nightmare and once more the boys did all they could to make it easier for me. After two days and two nights we arrived at our destination, sore, weary and hungry, but we were to get no food yet. First we were marched, myself being helped by two of the camp in which the offices, stores, guardroom, etc. are situated.&#160;</p>

         <p id="p118">Here we were searched, taken outside, photographed and finger prints taken. We could see about seventy-eight yards away a mob of chaps collected behind barbed wire watching us.</p>

         <p id="p146">We shouted, were told to shut up, they shouted, and were told the same thing, so we shouted again. This got the Germans really mad, one sarcastic security officer asked us the price of rats in England now, and someone answered about the same as your mice. That chap firmly believed that England was starving.</p>

         <div class="media-rw rwapp-temp figure-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-left-rw align-center-rw width-auto-rw exclude-auto-rw" id="figure2" style="width:100%;">


            <div class="pc-rw" id="pc55"><img alt="" src="images/ken020_a_online.jpg"/><p class="caption-rw" id="caption3">A membership certificate of some rarity.</p>

            </div>

         </div>

         <p id="p55">We were quickly formed up and away again, the American boys who had been with us up to this point were taken away first, as at that time each nationality was kept separate.</p>

         <p id="p56">We learned we were to go into the North Compound and away we went, as we marched up to the main gate another large crowd of chaps, little did I think then, that I should be one of that crowd searching each face of a new purge, as it was called, for an old friend or squadron cobber and to be disappointed so many times.</p>

         <p id="p57">This was a funny crowd, us on one side of the double fence, they on the other, both sides completely silent, guards unlocking the gates, when one chap could not stand it any longer and shouted, &#8220;For God's Sake say something, somebody&#8221; where upon the funny side struck everybody and a great laugh went round.&#160;</p>

         <p id="p119">One cannot in writing express the feeling of passing through the gates of a prison camp, that feeling of being out of everything, a thing that I can honestly say ninety-nine percent of the aircrew never contemplated. It was either the chop or safe to base.</p>

         <p id="p58">Interrogation by the camp security, each man had to identify himself, so that there was no chance of the Germans planting an outsider in the camp and everybody must try and find somebody who can vouch for him personally. This security I might say is run by the P.O.W.'s themselves to protect themselves and every man entering a compound was subjected to this scrutiny.</p>

         <p id="p59">Well everybody housed satisfactorily and being asked all sorts of questions on the progress of the war, only to find that the old <em>Kriegies</em> as P.O.W. called themselves, short for &#8219;<em>Krieps-Getangenen</em>&#8217; knew far more about it than we did, it was the camp's chief occupation, keeping genned up and where we could only name the large places on the Russian front, they could fill in with all the small villages, and I do believe even hamlets.
         </p>

         <p id="p60">When we arrived the camp was suffering from an acute shortage of potatoes, due the Germans said to Gibson VC bursting the Mohne Dam and flooding all that large potato growing area, and potatoes at all times were our main diet. Well I received treatment at last. Volunteer Masseurs and aspro&#8212;Doc's universal remedy, after the fourth day, had to give up as it was absolute agony, so decided just to rest it while the Doc negotiated with the Germans to get it x-rayed.</p>

         <p id="p61">Weeks passed, the chaps fitted into the routine of the camp, and one came to appreciate the efforts of the Red Cross more and more, the fiction library, the technical library, sports equipment for football, Rugby, Cricket and indoor games and not forgetting the all-important Red Cross food parcels. everybody had unstinted praise for the organisations that were helping to make life a little less unbearable.</p>

         <div class="media-rw rwapp-temp figure-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-left-rw align-center-rw width-auto-rw exclude-auto-rw" id="figure1" style="width:100%;">


            <div class="pc-rw" id="pc54"><img alt="" src="images/sl3_online.jpg"/><p class="caption-rw" id="caption2">A relatively rare photograph from inside Stalug Luft III. Apparently taken by a German who had been bribed with Red Cross offerings. Ken Pipe is at the back with the beard.</p>

            </div>

         </div>

         <p id="p62">We had all the sporting events of the world in our small camp, Soccer&#8212;we had England and Scotland matches, England versus the Rest, Rugger&#8212;New Zealand versus South Africans, New Zealand versus England and so it went on, sometimes matches were arranged to cover up other activities, for the guards would get as interested as the Kriegie spectators over a keen match.</p>

         <p id="p63">Most will have read in some magazine or newspaper about the big break from North Compound Luft III in which some fifty officers were shot. Well it was at this time it was being dug and making great headway, and the Germans having got wind of something were busy purging the camp and transporting these chaps to another compound, some ten kilometres distance on the other side of the town, Sagan. It happened that I was one of these lots and so left the compound for Belaria.</p>

         <h2 id="h24">Transfer to Belaria</h2>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p64">Belaria was a very small place compared with North Compound, only capable of holding roughly about four hundred and fifty men and comprising of six blocks, wash-houses and cook house. It was much better situated than the others however. Whereas they were completely surrounded by pine trees, here we were on top of a hill overlooking the town itself and also on a fairly busy road, which gave us much more interest in things outside the camp.</p>

         <p id="p65">It was shortly after arriving in this camp that I received my first mail. What a red letter day! I know that my people had heard that I was a P.O.W.</p>

         <p id="p66">Well life passed on from month to month, the occasional rumour would go through the camp like wildfire. I can recall at least three different occasions when the invasion had taken place, previous to it actually happening, then of course it was taken with a grain of salt by a great many.</p>

         <p id="p67">New chaps coming in, camp overcrowded, yes it would all be over by October, making great headway, no doubt home for Christmas, that brings bitter memories, I wonder how many P.O.W.&#8217;s said at Christmas time &#8220;Well chaps this will be the last one behind wires&#8221;, only to repeat it the following year and the following year and I have no doubt would still be saying it if necessary, but July and August 1944 it was different, as each new purge came in, it was in the bag, only to see August turn into September, September to October and realise that it wouldn&#8217;t be this year after all.</p>

         <p id="p68">Came January, the Russians who had been marking time for quite a while suddenly decided to push ahead again, bypassed Warsaw, swept across to Kronigsburg and on all their fronts made tremendous advances, Breslen reached and the road past our camp became full of refugees, German refugees.</p>

         <p id="p147">It was obvious that only a few days separated us from freedom, when it was rumoured that the Germans intended shifting us further to the West. This eventuated and I will quote from notes written at the time and headed &#8220;The Quitting of Belaria&#8221;.</p>

         <h2 id="h21">THE QUITTING OF BELARIA</h2>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p69">Saturday night 27 January, 1945, Johnny burst into the room at about half past eight &#8220;Hurry chaps, we are getting out within half an hour&#8221;.</p>

         <p id="p148">Just imagine the looks and stares, then the burst &#8220;Get out. You can't panic us!" &#8220;Bull.&#8221; &#8220;Don't believe it.&#8221; &#8220;Another rumour.&#8221;</p>

         <p id="p149">The camp had been seething with rumours for days past&#8212;would the Germans shift us? &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8220;No.&#8221; &#8220;Where were the Russians?&#8221; For days past refugees had been streaming past with horses and farm wagons. We had read of such things but never did we expect to see these events, especially through the barbed wire fence of a Kriegie camp.</p>

         <p id="p70">Well it was no rumour this time, we were on the move, which of course gave rise to more rumour. The Russian was almost here, he was across the Oder to the North, he had struck for Berlin, he was only fifty, forty, thirty, fifteen miles from the city. Berlin evacuated. They had divided, half the army had struck South and would cut us off.</p>

         <p id="p150">This was lent strength to by the fact that after packing what bit we could manage to carry and hustled out of the barracks by guards armed with tommy guns into the snow, we were brought to a stop about three hundred yards from the starting point, and after waiting three quarters of an hour, word passed around, return to barracks, as we would not be going for another two to two and half hours.&#160;</p>

         <p id="p120">What a chance for the rumour boys now and the &#8220;I told you so&#8217;s&#8221;. We wouldn't be shifted, it was too late, the Russians had advanced too far, the guards would leave us etc. Well back to the barracks.</p>

         <p id="p151">While waiting to leave the first time I had peeled a pot of potatoes and put them on the fire hoping we would have time to eat them. When we went out and left them on the fire, we couldn't have cared less if the pot burnt out. We had put all our carefully hoarded supply of fuel on to the fire, fuel, which we had begged, stolen and scrounged for emergencies. Anyway upon returning we found it boiling merrily and the spuds just right, so mashed them with what margarine we had left and all filled up the old tum.</p>

         <p id="p121">Another thing our short march had told us - our packs were too big. We would never manage with them as they were, so the whole camp more or less was turned over to sledge making, bed boards, coal boxes, cupboards, forms, tables, anything was hurriedly turned into sledges and at six the next morning when we were again turned out, a wonderful assortment met the eye. Four men, three men, one man and several extra big of six men, pulled out heavily laden with each man's most prized possessions.</p>

         <p id="p122">As we had continuous frosts from the middle of December onwards, the roads and tracks were coated with ice, which made it very easy sledging.</p>

         <p id="p152">As we passed out of the main gates we were handed a Red Cross parcel and our last per man for a very long time. What a sight, twelve hundred men with their sledges, wondering what was in store. Just another move on that old chequer board I guess and it proved the last move for quite a few of the chaps, even the Germans themselves had no idea of our final destination.</p>

         <p id="p71">We were counted, we had been given our parcel, the guards strung out along each side of us, and we set out like so many refugees, down the road from Belaria into Sagan. Here we met the same old line of farm wagons loaded with women and children and what few goods and chattels they could gather together.</p>

         <p id="p123">It certainly brought war home to one, and one hopes to the Germans. They were getting a taste of their own medicine of the &#8217;39-&#8217;40 days, the difference being that they were not subject to straffing aircraft.</p>

         <p id="p153">Well we passed through Sagan, curious stares from the people over the river; it was the same route that I had traversed almost twelve months before, when I was shifted from north Compound to Belaria.</p>

         <p id="p124">Saw the Germans putting in gun emplacements on the west side of the river. So along until we were passing along by Karlswalde where the main camps Centre, East, North, South and West are situated, we drew to a halt, speculation again was rife. Were we just being brought over the river? Were we going into one of these camps? We couldn't believe it, for all of them were deserted with this exception.</p>

         <p id="p72">Where we stopped we overlooked Centre Camp and could see the Censor girls and Luftwaffe searching the camp. They had suitcases and kitbags, packages of cigarettes, clothing and goodness knows what. They must have got a real haul, for if the camp was left anything like ours, there was pounds worth of stuff left behind. It made us mad to think that we could do nothing only wish them harm and it was with a certain amount of satisfaction we learned weeks later that Sagan had surrendered to the Russians.</p>

         <p id="p73">Well the column moved on past the Vorlager-North Camp. I noticed hut 103 burnt down&#8212;the boys must have got gay&#8212;then West Camp, all deserted. Apparently we were the last to leave, the road began to be strewn with different articles, chaps who had not had the luck of being able to construct sledges, but started out with packs too heavy, potatoes, clothing and books etc..</p>

         <p id="p125">On we walked, dragging our sledges; stopped thirty minutes for lunch, then on again, the sun very watery trying to shine, air crisp, pulling well and by late afternoon, about 20 kilometres travelled we reached a place called Kunau, the clouds had lowered, it started snowing, and it had grown much colder.</p>

         <p id="p126">We were taken into a large farmyard, were counted and allotted sleeping quarters in barns, cow sheds, pig stys, etc.. It was almost dark, hands and feet, one hardly knew they belonged. Managed to get some bread out of kit, margarine so hard it came away in chips, impossible to spread, had to put it into mouth then bite a piece of bread, a drink of cold milk, milk powder mixed with cold water, and so to bed&#8212;a bed made on sheaves of stacked linseed.</p>

         <p id="p127">What a night! Will I ever forget it ? I doubt it very much. Time, it is said, is a great softener, well it needs to be, for I would shiver violently for about ten minutes, which must have restored the circulation, for I would warm up for half an hour and the same thing would occur, one could hear chaps shivering violently all over the barn, some crying out with the cold.</p>

         <p id="p154">It was one of those times when one is glad morning arrives, no matter how bad it might be; raucous &#8220;<em>Aus Aus</em>&#8221; (German for &#8220;out&#8221;) and out the boys rolled stiff with the cold, hacking off a couple of slices of German bread and putting on whatever they fancied. I used margarine, jam and cheese. That was being very extravagant I knew, but felt I must have something to march on and keep out the cold.
         </p>

         <p id="p128">Counted once more, twelve missing, mostly French boys who could mix with French workers. They had slipped away during the night. Had to wish them the best of luck and hope that they made it.</p>

         <p id="p74">On the road once more, fewer refugees, the going still very good, a stop for ten minutes then on again. One thing that struck us was the attitude of the German civilian population. We expected to be shown hostility on all sides, but it was quite the reverse, the women would meet us at the road side with water and very often hot water.</p>

         <p id="p155">Early afternoon we reached a place called Goosse-Selten; this the 13th January, lined up in the streets in fives and counted once more; we then learned we were to spend the night there. After a walk of 13 kilometres, we were then marched off to the farm we were to occupy. I must describe one of these farms.</p>

         <p id="p75">They are invariably built in the form of a large square, the buildings forming the outside walls with a large yard, approximately between eighty to a hundred yards square. The buildings all open on to this, including quite often, several houses in which the farm workers live, the farmer's house itself is usually separate.</p>

         <p id="p76">After hunting around for places to sleep, eventually settled in an old pig sty which looked warm anyway, carried clean straw from one of the barns, got cracking on a fire, anything that comes to hand does for fuel and we made a real good stew, using the ingredients from our Red Cross parcels, we also had an issue of cooked barley which went down very well, and so to bed.</p>

         <p id="p77">Next day were told no move as the other camps ahead of us were blocking the way, so got socks and boots dry, sore feet attended to and rest etc.. A detachment of panzers arrived, they had abandoned their tanks&#8212;lack of petrol. One truck with bullet holes through the door and steering wheel told its own story. Significant of the effectiveness was a wooden cross in the back of the truck with the driver's name painted on. They hadn't had time to erect it.</p>

         <p id="p78">Pole and French farm workers seemed everywhere, girls and men, one wonders how the German agricultural situation would carry on without them for never does one see a young German worker. We stayed at Grosse-Selten two days&#8212;30th and 31st January.</p>

         <p id="p79">On the morning of 1st February we were on the move again and I guess that the farmer was glad to see the back of us, it looked as if a hurricane had hit the place. Well a march of seventeen kilometres brought us to Birkenstadt. We passed through the town, evidently brown coal was mined there and made into briquettes.</p>

         <p id="p80">Again we took over a farm, this by far the best that we had seen so far. We passed under an arch and were counted as we passed. This was amazing for goons&#8212;slang for Germans. Inside the yard everything looked cleaner and newer.</p>

         <p id="p129">Well the same old story hunting for beds, eventually everybody fixed up, it's amazing where a thousand to twelve hundred men get to, fires springing up in the yard, brews being made, the usual trade etc..</p>

         <p id="p156">That night the thaw set in and what a mess next morning, but word was given out that we would spend another day and night there so once again got cracking and cooked food etc., everybody hoping that it would freeze again, for if the thaw stayed we would have to pack our kit and carry it on our backs.</p>

         <p id="p81">Well that is what it came to, books and all sorts of odd little things were thrown away to lighten loads. Some more adventurous tried sledges but had to give up after a very short distance.</p>

         <p id="p82">The American boys who had been with us up to this point were separated, rumour saying that they were going to Nuremberg. Needless to say rumour was strong at all times as to our final destination.</p>

         <p id="p83">Another walk of twenty odd kilometres and we arrived at Granstein on the 3rd February. I must say that on this trip my back gave in. For quite a while I behaved very pig-headedly, refusing help, until the Doctor found me and went mad, so I allowed my pack to be put on the sick wagon (a wagon and horse which the Doc had purchased with chocolate, cigarettes and tea from one of the Germans fleeing from the Russians) for the last two kilometres.</p>

         <p id="p84">At Granstein for the first time we were split up into smaller parties as no one farm was big enough to accommodate us altogether.</p>

         <p id="p130">I had now joined the so-called sick party and must say my billet for this night was the best yet, made myself comfortable under an old chaff cutter with a fair packing of clean straw. Food getting low and broke into my reserve, a reserve we all carried just in case&#8212;meaning of course just in case an opportunity presented itself for a break.</p>

         <p id="p157">Out early next morning and on again. I found that by holding on to a rope tied on the back of the wagon I could get along passably even though each kilometre got longer and longer. I must confess it was with a certain amount of satisfaction that a larger town seemed to lay ahead of us.</p>

         <p id="p131">A rumour had it that we were to finish the rest of the journey by rail. The town turned out to be Spremburg and we were taken through part of it to a large German Military Camp, placed in large sheds and told that a meal was being prepared. It was quite obvious that this was a training school for budding tank units, for they had numerous tanks fitted with colossal gas producer units; again the German shortage of petrol and oil was exemplified.</p>

         <p id="p132">We got our meal, universal tucker but very welcome nevertheless. Barley stew&#8212;the first meal served by the Germans. We later marched another three kilometres through Spremburg (quite a large town) and exposed to the curious stare of the people&#8212;mostly girls, old women and old men, to the railway station.</p>

         <p id="p85">Then the train, yes it was true, cattle trucks again, forty to a truck, the door shut and locked and eventually got under way just at dark, still no clues to our destination.A ration of sixth of a loaf of bread per man to last till God knows when. Each man rummaged in his bag and made a meal of sorts then settled down as best as possible for the night. It was under exactly the same circumstances that I had travelled from Dulag Luft Frankfort to Sagan in October, 1943.</p>

         <p id="p133">One could only half sit, half lay&#8212;body would ache but no chance of moving. We travelled through the night. At times we seemed to go into reverse, at others stopped for long periods, every minute registering as sleep was impossible. Soon the effects of our soup wore off and all were just as hungry as ever.</p>

         <p id="p134">A slight greying in the East indicated that a new day was breaking and what a day that was. At any moment we expected to be shot at by our own planes for it was a day of one continuous air raid warning. Move&#8230; Stop&#8230; Move&#8230; Stop, until once more as the evening settled.</p>
