         <p id="p21">This is part of the World War Two story and the flying log of (then) Pilot Officer Kenneth Alfred Sydney Pipe, MBE, DFC. AKA Dad!</p>

         <p id="p54">Ken Pipe was born in Suffolk 18 September 1910. He enlisted in the RNZAF 4 June 1940 and completed service in the Middle East with 70th Squadron before undertaking European Operations. On his 58th sortie he was shot down over Hanover on the night of 22-23 September 1943.</p>

         <p id="p16">Unconscious, he fell a considerable distance before coming-to just in time to pull his rip cord. He landed in trees and was taken prisoner of war. His back was severely damaged in the fall.</p>

         <p id="p89">He was imprisoned in the infamous Stalag Luft III, scene of the Great Escape. As a NZ Air Force Officer, Dad was involved in the tunnelling operation although because of his damaged back this was the more passive role of turning empty tin-cans into air-ducts.</p>

         <p id="p90">He remained a POW until May 1945. After his return to New Zealand he remained in the RNZAF, firstly with the Northern Reserve and ATC, and later in RNZAF Supply based in Whenuapai. He retired 16 April 1962 and died 31 Jul 1974.</p>
